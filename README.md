This project was part of the interview for Project Kratos at BITS Pilani, Goa Campus. 

I have taken 7 types or classes of images, namely mountains, beaches, rivers, ocean, ice landmass, mars surface and moon surface. I have used a CNN architecture to train my model and have achieved a near 86% accuracy.

The dataset that i used in this project is completely custom made by me using Google Earth Pro application. I took around 100 images of each classes manually, making my training set a total of 700 images. I also saved my model as the validation loss decreased.

The dataset can be downloaded using the link in the code. It is also available on Kaggle

Kaggle API command: kaggle datasets download -d arjuntyagi25/satellite-images
